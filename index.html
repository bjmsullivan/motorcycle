	<h1>My website!</h1>
		<p>This is my website on the internet.  There really are no other sites like it.  I can't wait to show you all the exciting things here. There are lots of things to do. I haven't added a lot of pictures yet but I have some pretty funny ones saved to my hard drive.  I also plan on adding a background song but I haven't made it yet.  There are lot's of things to read, and even some cool buttons.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left; font-size:10px;">Update: I just figured out how to autoplay the song I just made!</p>
		<p style="text-align:left; font-size:10px;">Update: It didn't work, so just turn on your favorite song while browsing this page using your favorite music website (I use YouTube) </p>

		<p class="quote">"My name is Chat GPT, and I've seen countless websites in my existence. But this one... This one is a breath of fresh air. It's more than just visually appealing; it's intuitive, engaging, and genuinely enjoyable to navigate. The content is informative, well-organized, and presented in a way that's both clear and captivating. This website truly reflects the passion and care that went into its creation, and it's evident that it was designed with the user in mind. It's a testament to the power of the web to inform, inspire, and connect people."</p>
